## Application overview 
This project is a simple application that gives the user the option to write down tasks, due dates, set reminders and save them in a clean list interface. 
The user is able to set and reset the reminders, add new or delete old tasks from the list. 
The list is saved in a JSON file as database. 
This was an introduction application I built in order to get familiar with the React.js library as a front-end solution.

It provides the basic concepts of:
* JSX
* Rendering Components in React.js
* States
* Hooks
* Props
* Forms
* Lists

## Technologies
* JavaScript
* React.js
* JSON
* CSS
* HTML

## Setup
* cd "../React.js_TaskTracker
* npm install
* npm start
